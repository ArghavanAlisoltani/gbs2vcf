# gbs2vcf
End-to-end GBS variant-calling for plants: QC → trimming → alignment → joint genotyping → filtered VCFs. 

## Usage

The repository includes a placeholder script, `convert_gbs_to_vcf.sh`, which demonstrates the
expected interface for a future implementation. It copies the input file to the output
location and prints status messages.

Run it as:

```bash
./convert_gbs_to_vcf.sh input.vcf output.vcf
```
